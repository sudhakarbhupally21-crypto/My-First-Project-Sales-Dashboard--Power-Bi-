### 📈 Shop Nest Performance Optimizer (Power BI, Statistical Modeling)

This project focused on leveraging **Power BI** for advanced data visualization and **Statistical Modeling** to address operational bottlenecks for the Shop Nest e-commerce platform.

* 🎯 **Core Outcome:** Built a **dynamic, interactive dashboard** in Power BI providing **real-time visibility** into:
    * Regional Sales Performance
    * Product Performance & Revenue Trends
    * Logistics Bottlenecks and Fulfillment Delays

* 💡 **Key Insight (Delay Analysis):** Identified a **strong negative correlation** ($r < 0$) between increased order processing/fulfillment delay and customer satisfaction/repeat purchase rates using **Regression Analysis**. Delays were statistically validated as the primary driver of poor user experience.

* 🛠️ **Impact:** Recommended **targeted process improvements** and **inventory adjustments** for high-delay regions. The dashboard now serves as the central tool for tracking the health of the sales-to-delivery pipeline.
